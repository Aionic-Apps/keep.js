# keep.js

Writing notes from the command line quick and easy.

## Description

keep.js allows you to quickly write notes from the command line. It opens your system's default text editor and saves your entered text to a .txt file on your disk.

Your entered text is stored persistently. This means your old notes will show up again when you run keep.js for the next time.

## Installation

Install keep.js as global node package

```
npm i -g keep.js
```

Now you can run it from anywhere in your command line

```
keep
```

Afterwards, your system's default editor should pop up.
